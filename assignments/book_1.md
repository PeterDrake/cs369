# Social Context Book Part 1: Initial Impressions

Buy or borrow a copy of your book.

Look it over. Read the front and back cover.

Go through the table of contents. How is the book organized? What are the major sections? Are there appendices, a glossary, or an index?

Leaf through it looking for diagrams, pictures, section headers, highlighted terms, sidebars, etc.

Read the introduction, preface, and "about the author" section if your book has them.

Read the first 20 pages or so.

Now, with this information, decide if this is the book for you. Is the topic of interest? Do you enjoy the writing? Are you able to understand the jargon the author uses? Is it too dry, technical, philosophical, or advanced for you, or not enough? Do you find the claims interesting, compelling, or challenging? Does it seem like the author doesn't know what they're talking about or is trying too hard to sell something? Do you want to read the whole thing?

## What to Hand in

Write up and submit a description of the book as you understand it at this point. This should be a couple of paragraphs. Most reasonable formats will do (Google doc, .docx, .pdf, etc.).

***Be sure to include the title and author of your book in your response.*** Each student is reading a different book, so if you just say "the book" I don't know what you mean.

Finally, decide whether you want to stick with this book. If not, explain why not and choose another book.

As you continue reading (or start a different book), take notes. I expect you to bring up what you learn in classroom discussions. You'll also be asked to summarize and react to each third of the book in later assignments.
