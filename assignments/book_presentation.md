# Social Context Book Part 5: Presentation

In place of a final exam, people will speak to the class about their social context books. Be prepared to talk for five minutes. After the presentations, we will discuss recurring themes.

I will bring snacks and a dog.

Edit the linked Google Slides presentation with at least one slide (for example the cover of your book).

Advice:

* Remember that you are talking for 5 minutes, not 30 seconds or 15 minutes. Practice a bit and time yourself.
* Have something to say! Don't just get up there and improvise. 
* Have mercy on your classmates by making the talk worth their time. You don't need to cover all of the following, but here are some points to consider:
  * What are the title and author?
  * What are the author's qualifications?
  * What is the author's main point?
  * Is there some question the book addresses about which reasonable people might disagree? Does the author favor one side? What position do you take?
  * Did the book change your mind or your behavior?
  * Are there any amusing or mind-blowing anecdotes, facts, or statistics?
  * Would you recommend the book? Why?
* When speaking aloud, speak to the farthest person in the room. That way everyone will be able to hear you.
* You're welcome to use notes if you're nervous, but avoid reading from a script. Perhaps a bulleted list of points to cover?
* Don't use more than a few slides. If you just want to use one (the cover of the book), that's fine. The slides are for visuals (like graphs) that you can't convey well by speaking. Don't put a bunch of text on your slides and definitely don't read from the slides.
* Relax! This is not a high-stakes make-or-break presentation. Have fun sharing what you've learned.
