# Festival of Scholars and Artists

Attend (or give!) at least three presentations at the Festival of Scholars and Artists.

## What to Hand in

For each one, write one paragraph summarizing the presentation and a second paragraph connecting the presentation to this course. If you're coming up dry on those second paragraphs, here are some questions to get your creative juices flowing:

- How, if at all, was AI used in this project?
- How could AI have been used in this project?
- Are there ways AI could have been used in this project, but shouldn't?
- Does this project raise issues that developers of AI systems should take into account in their work?
