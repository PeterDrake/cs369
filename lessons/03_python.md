  * [Classes and Initializers](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/oop/classes.md)
  * [Methods](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/oop/methods.md)
  * [Magic Methods](https://github.com/alainkaegi/pythonorama/blob/main/oop/magic.md)

* Activity:
  * Define a class `Point` with x, y, and z attributes

  * Add a method `overlaps` to determine if a sphere overlaps with another
  * Advanced options:
    * Provide appropriate magic methods
    * Define a class `Box` with `volume` and `overlaps`
    * Allow `overlaps` to work between `Sphere`s and `Box`es.
